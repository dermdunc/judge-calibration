# Judge Calibration

**Classification:** factory-output
**Lifecycle:** active
**Owner:** dermdunc
**Promotion target:** `none`

> A provider-agnostic harness for calibrating an LLM judge against held-out human verdicts: multi-persona blind scoring, a hard fail-if-any-persona-flags-a-failure-mode gate, and a not_ready/provisional/calibrated verdict based on measured agreement.

## Implementation Status

- Scaffolded 2026-07-22 — initial setup in progress.

## Documentation Contract

Agents working here must inspect `.hekton/project.yaml` before structural changes, keep `docs/session-log.md` current, record meaningful design decisions in `docs/decisions.md`, and update `docs/next-actions.md` when the work queue changes.

Vault mutation policy: see `vault_mutation_allowed` in `.hekton/project.yaml` (authoritative; defaults to false at scaffold time). The repo-local `mind-palace/` folder is only a mirror draft; do not write to the live vault unless `.hekton/project.yaml` says mutation is allowed and it is explicitly authorised in-session.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add project-specific commands here
```
